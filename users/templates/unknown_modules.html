        <h3>Issue Importing Modules</h3>
        <p>
            We have had an issue when trying to import all of your course modules from Tabula. This an issue in the 
            Warwick systems. Not all of your modules will be shown on your dashboard. We have been notified of this and 
            will manually add these modules as soon as possible.  
        </p>
        <p>
            These modules are:
            <ul>
                {% for module in modules %}
                    <li>{{ module.module_code }}</li>
                {% endfor %}
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
